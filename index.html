This exam is conducted every year by IIM’s on rotational basis. CAT Exam Dates are generally declared in the month of August every year. <br><br>

Test pattern and duration<br><br>
Since last two years, the structure of the test has undergone a few changes. CAT is a computer based test which consists of 100 objective type questions. <br><br>
There are 3 sections in the test: <br><br>
•	Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VA , RC) <br>
•	Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR) <br>
•	Quantitative Ability (QA) <br><br>
The Quantitative Ability and Verbal& Reading Comprehension sections consist of 34 questions each, whereas the Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning section has 32 questions. Along with the objective type questions, there are some non-multiple choice questions in each section. Candidates have to answer in the space provided to them. <br><br>
The total duration of the test is 180 minutes or 3 hours. However, each section of the test has a time limit of 1 hour each. The test takers cannot switch between the sections and have to attend the test in a particular order. The order of the sections is-<br><br>
•	VA, RC<br>
•	DI & LR, and<br>
•	QA<br><br>
As per the marking scheme, each question carries 3 marks and there is negative marking of 1 mark for each wrong answer. There is no negative marking for the non-multiple choice questions. <br><br>
Four scaled scores will be presented for each candidate: an overall scaled score and three separate scaled scores for each section. As the three sections evaluate distinct sets of knowledge and skills, scores do not correlate across sections. A high score in one section does not guarantee a high score in another section. Percentile rankings are provided for each individual section as well as for the overall exam score. <br><br>
